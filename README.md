# Predict 1D acoustic field with temperature gradient using PINNs
This repository provides an efficient, customizable approach to predict the one-dimensional acoustic field in a uniform duct with axial temperature gradient in the MATLAB environment using L-BFGS optimizer. The theory associated with the code is available in the article https://doi.org/10.3397/IN_2024_3663.

In this repository, the code associated with the uniform duct with axial temperature gradient, which is ideal for researchers, students, and practitioners in acoustics, computational physics and scientific machine learning, is provided.

Comments are available at the respective sections inside the code and are self-explanatory.
